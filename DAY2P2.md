# Find Peak Element
---
- ## Question:
> A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.
> 
> Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.
> 
> You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -∞. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.
> 
> You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.
---
- ## Example:
> Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
> 
> Output: 2
> 
> Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.

- ## Solution:
**Code :**
```java
class Solution {
    public int findPeakElement(int[] arr) {
        int start=0;
        int end=arr.length-1;
        while(start<end)
        {
            int mid= start+ (end-start)/2;
            if(arr[mid]>arr[mid+1])
            {
                end=mid;
            }
            else
            {
                start=mid+1;
            }
        }
        return start;
    }
}
